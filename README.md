# Tests Performed
We timed how long it took to run 10,000 binary/linear searches of the worst case type (searching for an element not in the list) on arrays of length **ADD POPULATE** 1,000 10,000 100,000 1,000,000 10,000,000 and 100,000,000.

# Results

```
List Size = 1000
=============
Binary worst case = 7
Linear worst case = 20
```
With an array of length 1,000 it took 7 milliseconds to find an element not in the array using a binary search 10,000 times, and 20 milliseconds to find an element not in the array using a linear search 10,000 times.

```
List Size = 10000
=============
Binary worst case = 1
Linear worst case = 60
```
With an array of length 10,000 it took 1 millisecond to find an element not in the array using a binary search 10,000 times, and 60 milliseconds to find an element not in the array using a linear search 10,000 times.

```
List Size = 100000
=============
Binary worst case = 1
Linear worst case = 613
```
With an array of length 100,000 it took 1 millisecond to find an element not in the array using a binary search 10,000 times, and 613 milliseconds to find an element not in the array using a linear search 10,000 times.

```
List Size = 1000000
=============
Binary worst case = 0
Linear worst case = 6406
```
With an array of length 1,000,000 it took 0 milliseconds to find an element not in the array using a binary search 10,000 times, and 6,406 milliseconds to find an element not in the array using a linear search 10,000 times.

```
List Size = 10000000
=============
Binary worst case = 1
Linear worst case = 74222
```
With an array of length 10,000,000 it took 1 millisecond to find an element not in the array using a binary search 10,000 times, and 74,222 milliseconds to find an element not in the array using a linear search 10,000 times.

```
List Size = 100000000
=============
Binary worst case = 1
Linear worst case = 760961
```
With an array of length 100,000,000 it took 1 millisecond to find an element not in the array using a binary search 10,000 times, and 760,961 milliseconds to find an element not in the array using a linear search 10,000 times.

# Conclusions
Binary is **FAST**.

Due to the fact that we, [and other people](https://piazza.com/class/kue5pmk0w7n70n?cid=382_f3), observed over inflated values on the first runs for both linear and binary searches, we decided to ignore these data values.

The linear cases tended to show something resembling *linear growth*. \
Note that as the list size increases by a factor of 10, the linear time also increases by roughly a factor of 10.

Even though it doesn't represent logarithmic growth as well as the linear case represents linear growth, the binary worst cases stay very close to 0 and 1, suggesting a more logarithmic growth.

<summary> Better Logarithmic Data </summary>

To better demonstrate logarithmic growth, we ran Binary Search 1,000,000 times on lists of size 1 10 100 1,000 10,000 100,000 1,000,000 10,000,000 and 100,000,000. \
Here was our data
```
List Size = 1
=============
Binary worst case = 67

List Size = 10
=============
Binary worst case = 278

List Size = 100
=============
Binary worst case = 671

List Size = 1000
=============
Binary worst case = 1160

List Size = 10000
=============
Binary worst case = 2028

List Size = 100000
=============
Binary worst case = 2622

List Size = 1000000
=============
Binary worst case = 3350

List Size = 10000000
=============
Binary worst case = 4389

List Size = 100000000
=============
Binary worst case = 5167
```
Since as we exponentially increase the list size, the time increases linearly, this suggests logarithmic growth.
