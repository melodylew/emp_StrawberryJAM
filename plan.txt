0. Instantiate BinSearch and LinSearch
1. populate( int[] a)
  -for loop that iterates through the indices of a and fills a with its index
  EDIT: Method populate that takes an integer array a. (de Java-fy)
  
  
*in binSearchTime( Comparable[] a, Comparable target)*
EDIT: Method binSearchTime that takes a comparable array a and a comparable target
1. long variables: start and finish
  - start = currentTimeMillis
2. Run BinSearch
3. finish = currentTimeMillis
4. return finish-start


*in linSearchTime( Comparable[] a, Comparable target)*
EDIT: Method linSearchTime that takes a comparable array a and a comparable target
1. long variables: start and finish
  - start = currentTimeMillis
2. Run LinSearch
3. finish = currentTimeMillis
4. return finish-start


**Use different array sizes to test**
EDIT: Multiply the array length by 3 each time.
