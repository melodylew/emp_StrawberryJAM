0. Instantiate BinSearch and LinSearch

1. Method populate taking an integer array
   Populates the array so that every element is equal to its index

2. Method binSearchTime taking comparable array and comparable target
   Times how long it takes to complete 1,000 binary searches looking for the given target in the given array

3. Method linSearchTime taking comparable array and comparable target
   Times how long it takes to complete 1,000 linear searches looking for the given target in the given array

4. Main method
   Uses an array a, starting with size 1,000
   Reports how long it takes to find -1 (an element not in a) by using binSearchTime and linSearchTime
   Increases the length of a by a factor of 10 and repeats for array lengths of 1,000 10,000 100,000 1,000,000 10,000,000 and 100,000,000
