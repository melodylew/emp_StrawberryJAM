DISCOVERY: currentTimeMillis is a method in SYSTEM, which we don't have to import
NOTE: currentTimeMillis is a long, DON'T FORGET
JM suggested having new methods binSearchTime( Comparable[] a, Comparable target ) and linSearchTime( Comparable[] a, Comparable target )
  These will keep track of how long it takes for a bin/linSearch call on array a with target target takes.
  They will return longs
ML suggested including populate( int[] a )
JM suggested that populate( int[] a ) would fill a with NON random values, since BinSearch requires a to be sorted.
QUESTION: Should binSearchTime and linSearchTime go in BinSearch.java and LinSearch.java or SearchDriver.java?
