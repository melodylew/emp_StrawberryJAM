2021-12-16 PLANNING
DISCOVERY: currentTimeMillis is a method in SYSTEM, which we don't have to import
NOTE: currentTimeMillis is a long, DON'T FORGET
JM suggested having new methods binSearchTime( Comparable[] a, Comparable target ) and linSearchTime( Comparable[] a, Comparable target )
  These will keep track of how long it takes for a bin/linSearch call on array a with target target takes.
  They will return longs
ML suggested including populate( int[] a )
JM suggested that populate( int[] a ) would fill a with NON random values, since BinSearch requires a to be sorted.
QUESTION: Should binSearchTime and linSearchTime go in BinSearch.java and LinSearch.java or SearchDriver.java?

2021-12-17 FEEDBACK
YAH: I'd suggest searching for an element that is not present in the array, as well. That could show you how long it takes to "fail" :)
YAH: After getting the times, then what? How would y'all analyze the results?

2021-12-18 SearchDriver
-StrawberryJAM coded populate(), binSearchTime(), and linSearchTime().
-NullPointerException Error occurred because i was greater than a.length... should be less than.
-LinearSearch takes a much longer time to search...typically around its 6th iteration it takes a long time to print the time.
-Tested with a large array and with worst cases
-JM discovered that ctrl t shows how long you've been waiting in Terminal (meant to press cmd t but accidentally discovered this instead!)
