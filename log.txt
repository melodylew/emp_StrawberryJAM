Time Spent: 5 hrs

---2021-12-16 PLANNING---
DISCOVERY: currentTimeMillis is a method in SYSTEM, which we don't have to import
NOTE: currentTimeMillis is a long, DON'T FORGET
JM suggested having new methods binSearchTime( Comparable[] a, Comparable target ) and linSearchTime( Comparable[] a, Comparable target )
  These will keep track of how long it takes for a bin/linSearch call on array a with target target takes.
  They will return longs
ML suggested including populate( int[] a )
JM suggested that populate( int[] a ) would fill a with NON random values, since BinSearch requires a to be sorted.
QUESTION: Should binSearchTime and linSearchTime go in BinSearch.java and LinSearch.java or SearchDriver.java?

---2021-12-17 FEEDBACK---
YAH: I'd suggest searching for an element that is not present in the array, as well. That could show you how long it takes to "fail" :)
YAH: After getting the times, then what? How would y'all analyze the results?

---2021-12-18 SEARCHDRIVER---
-StrawberryJAM coded populate(), binSearchTime(), and linSearchTime().
-NullPointerException Error occurred because i was greater than a.length... should be less than.
-LinearSearch takes a much longer time to search...typically around its 6th iteration it takes a long time to print the time.
-Tested with a large array and with worst cases (the target is not in the array)
-JM discovered that ctrl t shows how long you've been waiting in Terminal (meant to press cmd t but accidentally discovered this instead!)

---2021-12-20 TESTS---
-Do NOT count the time it takes for an "average" run of binary/linear, instead only check worst case scenarios (reformatted SearchDriver)
-Increase the amount of times we search in the SearchTime methods while we decreased the number of elements in the array.
-Originally repeated the line of code calling BinSearch/LinSearch over and over instead of using a loop to avoid computation
 Due to a tip from Dr. Wu we replaced this with a while loop, since the loop will add negligible time and will be add the same time for each search
-Java exceeds limits between 2 and 3 billion
-WEIRD: FIRST TEST CASE TAKES WAY LONGER THAN THE REST?!?!?!?

---2021-12-20 FORMATTING---
-Discovered collapsable md text
-Linear search data quickly represents an example of linear data (and represents it very well)
-Binary search data does NOT represent logarithmic data until the number of times the search is executed is increased (by a few factors of 10) (and represents it decently)

---2021-12-21 GALLERY TOUR---
-Did a gallery tour and decided to make some edits (see below)
-Do the first test case twice to get rid of the initial lag
-Add number of searches as a parameter binSearchTime() and linSearchTime()
-Conclude the relationship between the array length and the elapsed time it takes for binary search and linear search to find a target *not* in the array
