DISCO:
0. NullPointerException Error: a variable is accessed which is not pointing to any object and refers to null
1. A _ can replace a comma in a number (e.g. 100,000,000 -> 100_000_000). This is good for legibility (100_000_000 as opposed to 100000000)
2. ctrl t shows how long you've been waiting in Terminal (accidentally discovered)
3. It is much harder to get our Binary Worst Case to be 1 millisecond compared to our Linary (Linear) Worst Case.

QCC:
0. A method should be static if you want to run it in the main().
1. Not getting average amount of time each type of search takes, only the total time.
2. Do we increase the number of iterations or wait the whole time? We increase!
3. Java is not flooring our time, rather the time operates on an integer level so it is automatically "floored".
