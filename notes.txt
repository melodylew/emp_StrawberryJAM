DISCO:
0. NullPointerException Error: a variable is accessed which is not pointing to any object and refers to null 
1. A _ can replace a comma in a number (e.g. 100,000,000 -> 100_000_000). This is good for legibility (100_000_000 as opposed to 100000000)

QCC:
0. A method should be static if you want to run it in the main().
1. Not getting average amount of time each type of search takes, only the total time.
